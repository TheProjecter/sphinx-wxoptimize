Anchors

In unmodified sphinx-generated htmlhelp, the anchor below doesn't work before
conversion.  Neither clicking its link in the contents pane nor clicking on a
reference from another page a brings the the link in view.

Lots

blank

lines

make

sure

that

the

initial

anchor

is

off

screen

to

prove

that

clicking

on

the

anchor

scrolls

to

where

it's

supposed

to

go.

Anchor Should Scroll Here
=========================

This is the anchor target.  Unmodified htmlhelp doesn't find this target, it
moves to the top of the file.
