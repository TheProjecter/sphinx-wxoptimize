Basic Formatting Fixups
***********************

In unmodified sphinx-generated htmlhelp:

* there are multiple blank lines before the title.
* the navigation list is on multiple lines
* clicking on anchors in the text (see :ref:`anchorhere`) moves to the top of
  the page rather than scrolling to the target

All these problems are fixed after sphinx-wxoptimize is run
