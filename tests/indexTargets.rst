links on this page, and clicking one of the hyperlinks on the index should
scroll back to the correct location on this page.

Link Target from Other Page
===========================

This is a sample link target.  Other pages that use this reference for a target
should scroll all the way down to the bottom of the page.

There is a bug in the wxHtmlHelp system that prevents this in some cases.
