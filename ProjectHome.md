The sphinx document processor generates HTML that uses more advanced syntax than the HtmlHelp browser in wxPython and wxWidgets can render.  This program uses the htmlhelp files generated by sphinx as input and attempts to remove elements that confuse the wxHtmlHelp system while adding or modifying elements in an attempt to allow the wxHtmlHelp to render the HTML as closely as possible to the HTML as viewed by a modern browser.

This package provides a script `sphinx-wxoptimize` that is designed to be integrated into your `make htmlhelp` target that will automatically reprocess the sphinx-generated htmlhelp files and convert them to be better rendered in the wxPython or wxWidgets wxHtmlHelpController.
